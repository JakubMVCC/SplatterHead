                        <p class="paragraph-text">Howdy, my name is Jakub. I'm an oddball from Slovakia and the creator behind Splatter Head. I've been passionate about making videos for over 15 years now ever since teaching myself the ins and outs of video editing. My journey has been driven by the hope that one day my skills could lead towards kickstarting a long lasting professional career in filmmaking and video production. Which is what brought me back to College in pursuit of a Multimedia Designer certificate and is where Splatter Head was created. This is not just a school project but a combination of years of passion, learning, and a significant step towards realizing that dream.</p>

                    <p>Splatter Head is a cheesy claymation video born out of a final project for my Fall 2024 Video Editing class at my College. I wanted to do something fun and decided to challenge myself with an over the top stopmotion action video as I blast my way through hordes of zombies trying to get a taste of the new Splatter Head drink that just dropped in stores. I dedicated a significant amount of time to bringing this idea to life but had to separate the video into separate parts, with Part 2 being used as the final project in my Spring 2025 After Effects class. Now that both parts are (hopefully) finished, I've combined them into the final Splatter Head video which you can enjoy by visiting the <a href="index.html">Home Page.</a></p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">Splatter Head is a love letter to a lot of the classic horror movies and games I enjoyed throughout the years. From the over the top gore of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evil Dead films</a> mixed with the suspense of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alien franchise</a> and the zombie mayhem seen in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077402/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of the Dead</a>. Video games definitely play a huge part in anything I do as well. With the creepy atmosphere of <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dead-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dead Space</a>, plus <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resident Evil's</a> T-Virus infestation being in the back of my mind. And how could I forget just how impactful the original <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exorcist</a> as well as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> were on my innocent mind. Not only that but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirited Away</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney's Gargoyles</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0918940/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarzan</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters Inc.</a>, the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17163970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallace & Gromit</a> movies, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120630/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicken Run</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841929/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat & Mat</a> helped me appreciate the diverse potential of animation and visual storytelling.</p>

                    <h2 id="challenges-splatterhead">What was the most challenging part of Splatter Head?</h2>
                    <p>The amount of time needed to do Stopmotion. Every single scene and every movement requires moving characters centimeters at a time, frame by frame. You have to build the entire set, create the characters from scratch, manage lighting constantly, and you often don't know if a shot worked until you review the footage later. A simple bump of the table can mean redoing an entire take, which happened many times during the making of Splatter Head.</p>
