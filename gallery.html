                <h1>Behind the Scenes Image & Video Gallery</h1>
                 <p>This gallery is a collection of exclusive images and video clips captured during the making of Splatter Head. Here you'll find a variety of behind the scenes goodies such as: Characters under construction, the miniature sets taking shape, glimpses of the animation process in action, and maybe even some outtakes or tests that didn't make the final cut.</p>
                <p>Consider this your visual diary of the Splatter Head production: Raw, unfiltered, and offering a unique look at the intricate, time consuming, and ultimately rewarding craft of claymation.</p>
