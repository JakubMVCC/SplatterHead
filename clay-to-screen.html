                <h1>From Clay to Screen: The Stop Motion Animation Process Uncovered</h1>
                <section>
                    <h3>Explanation of Stop Motion and Why Claymation</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qsY0BOP.jpeg" alt="King Kong 1933 Poster" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Stop motion animation is a classic filmmaking technique where physical objects are moved in small amounts between individually photographed frames. When you play these frames back in rapid succession, it creates the illusion that the objects are moving on their own. Think of it like building a movie one picture at a time. Each photograph captures a minuscule change, and stringing hundreds or thousands of these photos together brings characters and scenes to life. This method has been used in early films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/" target="_blank">King Kong</a> to animate monsters which were then integrated into live action footage. Over the years, stop motion evolved into the sophisticated art form seen in beloved films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104361/" target="_blank">Wallace and Gromit</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107688/" target="_blank">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327597/" target="_blank">Coraline</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057197/" target="_blank">Jason and the Argonauts</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/" target="_blank">Isle of Dogs</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interest/in0000030/" target="_blank">so many more</a>. Starting over 120 years ago for trick effects, stop motion grew into a powerful way to create fantasy worlds and tell unique stories.</p>

                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IGkTqAk.jpeg" alt="Wallace & Gromit A Grand Day Out Poster" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">I specifically chose to make Splatter Head using stop motion animation with clay figures, which is typically known as Claymation. The reason for this is because clay is very easy to shape by hand which helps when creating any character, monster, or prop needed without expensive equipment. Adjustments can be made directly to the clay figure between frames, instead of needing an entirely new puppet for different expressions or poses. Clay is also cheap, accessible in many colors, and easily sticks together to itself. Not only that, claymation possesses a unique, "real" aesthetic that I enjoy the look of quite alot. The slight jitteriness between frames, the visible fingerprints, and DIY imperfections all contribute to a charming, handmade look that's hard to replicate otherwise. It's a classic technique with a certain magic to it that felt like the perfect fit for what I wanted to accomplish with Splatter Head.</p>

                    <h3>Pre-production: Planning the Animation</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ecw4WFx.jpeg" alt="Image 1 of the Splatter Head Storyboard" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">The journey of Splatter Head began as a Final Project idea for my Premiere Pro: Video Editing Class in Fall 2024. Originally, I proposed an animated story based on a personal experience. However, realizing that might be too time consuming, I shifted towards something cheesier, light hearted, and visually appealing that could be understand even without audio. I've created a number of videos and stories throughout the years to know which ideas work best with my editing style. From the start, I knew that I wanted to recreate myself in clay and be the main protagonist in Splatter Head. Nine out of ten times I organize my thoughts by drawing them out into a storyboard, which is basically sketching out each scene square by square on paper. Once I have a feeling of how I want the video to play out, everything begins to fall into place. Ideas like skateboarding through a zombie hoard with a shotgun and launching onto a helicopter emerged, with the challenge being how to combine everything together so it all makes sense from start to end. Under each drawn square, I'd write a brief description of the action, any camera movement, and the scene number. My storyboards are all over the place, filled with crossed out shots and arrows rearranging scenes out of order, but this process is crucial no matter how messy it appears.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image image-left">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GTbNpOS.jpeg" alt="Image 2 of the Splatter Head Storyboard" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Storyboards are absolutely vital in animation, especially stop motion. They serve as the blueprint, helping to plan the entire animation before filming even begins. This process organizes ideas, visualizes the story flow scene by scene, as well as clarifies the intended action, timing, and emotion. Most importantly, storyboarding saves immense time and effort. Animating with stop motion is very slow, where even just a few seconds of footage can take several hours or days to capture. Without a storyboard, you risk wasting valuable time on scenes or shots that don't make the final cut or don't work with the overall story. It allows you to catch potential mistakes early, plan different camera angles, and decide on special effects before committing to the tedious animation process. For me, spending the extra time on storyboarding is the difference between frustrating inefficiency and having extra saved time towards refining the final product into the best version it can be.</p>

                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LZ4XLir.jpeg" alt="Image of the Clay Characters for Splatter Head" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Next came bringing the characters to life in clay. I knew that there would at least be two characters in Splatter Head: myself and the zombies. For the zombies themselves, I modeled three different figurines after the characters in <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies" target="_blank">Plants vs. Zombies</a> as an Easter Egg to one of my favorite games. Imperfections in their creation, such as their head shape differing slightly from another, actually work towards enhancing that decayed zombie look. For my own figurine though, consistency was key. I recreated my look with a black shirt, blue pants, glasses, beard, mustache, long hair, and my signature hat (which I wore everyday in school to cement that iconic look for my classmates). Creating the figurines started out as rough drawings to ensure their shape, size, and final look which was probably the easiest part of the entire Splatter Head video.</p>

                    <h3>Building the Characters and Sets</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image image-left">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/o7IjA0x.jpeg" alt="Image of an Armature built for Splatter Head" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">To ensure the clay characters could stand, hold poses, and be animated without falling apart, I built armatures for them. An armature acts like an internal skeleton made of aluminium wire, providing support and flexibility. Without one, clay figures can easily collapse under their own weight or due to gravity during the lengthy animation process, ruining shots. The armature allows for smoother movements, helps maintain the character's shape frame after frame, and makes the filming process go by a little bit smoother. I even added magnets to the feet of my figures to help them stand securely on the set during animation. Building a sturdy armature is crucial for claymation, preventing unwanted sagging and giving you full control over the character's movements. For a detailed, step by step look at exactly how I constructed my armatures, be sure to check out the dedicated <a href="armature-guide.html">"How to Make Your Own Armature Guide"</a> article!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/G5m6Gad.jpeg" alt="Image of my Cardboard Set for Splatter Head" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Creating the sets for Splatter Head wasn't too difficult either, as I mainly relied on available materials like cardboard and colored paper. Since everyone seems to have spare cardboard lying around, I borrowed enough pieces and used them as the primary building material. Depending on what background the scene needed, I would either paint large cardboard pieces to look like walls or cut and glue smaller shapes together to construct buildings before adding highlights with Sharpies. These miniature sets were then placed on a table or the floor for filming and taped into place. For backgrounds and the "grass," I used large sheets of colored paper and painted in details like the trees, clouds, flowers, or birds before taping them together into a 5ft long mural. To save time and resources, I frequently reused set pieces and backgrounds, relying on camera angles and editing tricks to make them appear as different locations. Due to limited space, I typically only built enough of a set to fill the camera's view for a specific shot. While the final film might look like I had a giant environment filled with zombies, in reality it was probably the same corner rearranged in a different way combined with some green screen techniques. I even used <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> to recreate entire scenes in 3D since I couldn't really get a similar effect any other way without spending more time or resources, but more on that later. This approach of reusing and repurposing elements was important for bringing the world of Splatter Head to life in the time I had.</p>

                    <h3>Production: The Stop Motion Animation</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image image-left">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WuGtI6w.jpeg" alt="Image of my Camera SetUp for Splatter Head" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">The actual recording of Splatter Head used whatever equipment I already had on me to get the job done. I mainly recorded with my <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s9/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S9+</a> phone mounted on a generic tripod to capture the images, surrounded by a few $5 Clamp Lights I've collected throughout the years from Home Depot. Consistent lighting helps avoid flickering in the final animation and having a tripod to stabilize the camera is not negotiable in stop motion. Even the slightest camera movement between frames will be noticeable and can potentially ruin a shot, which wastes valuable time that could be used on other scenes. I then connected my phone via USB to my computer, which used <a href="https://www.dragonframe.com/" target="_blank">Dragonframe</a> for most of the stop motion process. This software allowed me to capture frames remotely, review the animation sequence as I worked, and utilize features like onion skinning to ensure smooth motion. While I also own a <a href="https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dslr802.html" target="_blank">Canon 7D DSLR</a> camera, which I would have preferred to use as its manual control and higher image quality would have outperformed the phone by miles, the USB port is broken, making it currently unusable with my computer for stop motion.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TXJfhgm.jpeg" alt="Image 1 of a Scene before VFX" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">The core of the production process is frame by frame animation, which is where you create the illusion of movement by taking individual pictures, making tiny adjustments to your characters or objects between each shot. When these pictures are played back quickly, the objects appear to move as if they are alive. Since Splatter Head used a framerate of 30 frames per second, this means that for every ONE SECOND of finished film footage, I had to animate and capture 30 separate photographs. Depending on the speed of your movement and how smooth you want the final result to appear, something as simple as waving a character's hand can be anywhere from 5 to 50+ frames. Starting with the hand down, you take a picture, move the hand up slightly, take another picture, move it again, take another picture, then back down, and so on, until the hand reaches its final position. Now imagine animating multiple characters simultaneously, which is a skill I still need much practice in as it requires careful coordination and immense patience. Most of the time, I found it easier to animate those characters separately and then edit them together for the final shot, but it's still incredibly time intensive no matter how you do it. Despite animation being tedious, seeing everything all come together is incredibly rewarding no matter how many times I've done it now.</p>

                    <h3>Post-production: Putting It All Together</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image image-left">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V3DMVkT.jpeg" alt="Image 2 of a Scene before VFX" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Once all the individual frames were captured using <a href="https://www.dragonframe.com/" target="_blank">Dragonframe</a>, the post-production phase began, where everything gets assembled into the final video. My editing software of choice is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>, a program I've used for years and am very comfortable using even with my eyes closed. Inside Premiere, I imported all the image sequences, arranged them on the timeline, adjusted the timing to ensure smooth playback, and watched the raw scenes take shape. This stage involves carefully reviewing the footage for any errors or imperfections. If I noticed issues within specific frames like an unwanted shadow, my hand accidentally caught in the shot, or a visible support rig holding up a character, then I would export that frame to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> and manually edit out the mistake before bringing it back into the sequence. Usually this cleanup process works most of the time, but it's safe to assume that every scene in Splatter Head had to be reanimated at least a few times before I was satisfied with the final result.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/c7e8Twa.png" alt="Screenshot of Programs used in Splatter Head" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">After the basic sequence editing and cleanup, I moved on to adding visual effects and sound design. Most of Splatter Head was created by capturing effects "in camera" using practical methods like sculpting clay explosions and blood to add to that overall cheesy charm. Even then, for digital effects like smoke, muzzle flashes reflecting onto the background, or keying out characters from their background, I mainly used <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html" target="_blank">Adobe After Effects</a>. Not only that, but I also taught myself the basics of <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> to take advantage of this amazing free 3D animation program for certain challenging scenes or effects. Learning Blender allowed me to create shots that would have been incredibly difficult or time consuming to achieve practically, such as scenes requiring large numbers of zombies in an open field. Instead, I recorded characters behind a green or red screen, and then digitally placed multiple zombie models within a 3D environment, varying their sizes and distances, to integrate these shots with my claymation footage and make the world feel much larger. Sound is really important in any video as well, so I recorded most of the sound effects myself, including zombie grunts, shotgun blasts, and all sorts of random noises to make Splatter Head come to life. There might not be background music in every scene, but any music that is there was intentionally added to provoke a certain feeling from the audience. Having an opening title scene wasn't originally in my Storyboard but it was one of the requirements for the Fall 2024 Video Editing class, so I improvised and asked a friend to voice act as the news reporter during the beginning of Splatter Head. Finally, once the visuals, effects, and sound are all layered and perfected in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank">Premiere Pro</a>, the last step is rendering, which is where the entire project is exported into a final video file, ready to be shared with the world. This entire post-production process brings together all these elements that could have been recorded weeks or months apart, which is why the storyboard was essential for keeping me on track.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image image-left">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WP2Cr4c.jpeg" alt="Image related to paragraph 12" class="paragraph-image-left">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Looking back on the creation of Splatter Head, the single most challenging aspect was definitely finding and maintaining a large enough working area that would remain undisturbed. Setting up the miniature sets, lighting, and camera requires a dedicated space where everything can remain untouched, potentially for days or weeks between animation sessions. Constant lighting is crucial, and the environment needs to be completely controlled to prevent accidental bumps or changes that could ruin hours of work. The ability to leave a scene set up overnight and return the next day to continue animating exactly where I left off was difficult to manage in my small room. This challenge is partly why the idea of using <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> for certain parts came up, as the 3D environment offers more freedom from physical space limitations, even though it has its own learning curve. If I actually wanted to create a really large scene, like buildings falling by giant monsters crashing into them, then doing it on the computer would offer possibilities that are very hard to achieve practically with clay without enormous amounts of space and resources.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                    <div class="paragraph-with-image">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wkrEDIc.jpeg" alt="Image showing the Clay character crumbling away" class="paragraph-image">
                        <p class="paragraph-text">Other challenges included actually using clay itself, which would sometimes fuse together, crumble apart, or cause the characters' poses to slowly sag over time. The magnets I used weren't as strong as I would have liked either, and more expensive ones combined with a metal surfaced table might have made positioning the figures easier. Timing the animation to get smooth movements to appear fast or slow also required a lot of trial and error that could have been achieved in a better way. Regardless, it's hard to say just how long Splatter Head actually took in total, but the first half of the video took roughly three to four weeks of work during my Fall 2024 Semester, covering everything from character creation to storyboarding and filming. I then had about two weeks to complete the second half during Spring 2025, making the total estimated work time around a month and a half, not counting the countless hours spent editing and refining everything. Fun Fact: Despite my job at the time stating that I could take off as much as needed to focus on finishing Splatter Head before the deadline for my school finals, they actually fired me not long after as a result of "not being at work when we needed you most". I passed with a 98% in my class.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-text">If I were to do things differently, I'd probably give myself more time throughout the Semester to slowly work on Splatter Head instead of trying to complete all of my Finals at the same time. That was the original plan anyway, but I've been so busy juggling through 15 credits (5 classes) that it didn't work out as I had hoped. Maybe choosing such an ambitious and large scale project for a final wasn't the sanest decision either, but I enjoy the challenge and am incredibly proud of Splatter Head. Not only did I want to create something impressive to share with my classmates, but I also wanted to showcase the potential of these animation techniques. My hope is to inspire others to practice, find their own style, and see what they can achieve. My closing thought is simply that I'm really happy I made Splatter Head and connected back with my roots towards cheesy action videos, be it with stop motion or live action videos. It was an immense amount of work, but seeing how it turned out and being able to use it as the centerpiece for finals in five classes (Premiere Pro, After Effects, Web Development, Photoshop, and Intro to Adobe) feels incredibly rewarding. I planned from the beginning to focus this semester's creative energy on Splatter Head, allowing me to dive deep into the project while efficiently passing every one of my classes with near 100% in Spring 2025.</p>
